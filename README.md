# Zil Vision Heads

Zilliqa tends to be a network with a capability of having highest number of transactions per second among all the other blockchain networks. Hence the zilliqa tends to target a large community of people and also people from differernt diversity and believes.

I have implemented a python code to the blender 3D software and started to generate a collection of generative NFTs in which all the people have different traits. Apart from these vision-heads belonging from different diversity but they all have the same vision and the seek the future in Zilliqa.

Considering all the different characteristics there can be over 1 million vision-heads possible but as of now I am keeping the numbers limited to 5555 so that the rarity can we maintained.
